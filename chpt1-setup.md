# Getting Set Up

For this course, computing will initially be done on an education server (`pbcbiedcit.services.brown.edu`) provided by the Brown Center for Biomedical Informatics (BCBI). You will interact with pbcbiedcit from your computer (laptop or desktop) using your Brown network identifier (netid) and password. Your computer is the “client” or “local” machine while pbcbiedcit is the “server” or “remote” machine.

## VPN Client

Brown's Virtual Private Network (VPN) connects you to Brown's network when you are off campus. You might use VPN to access campus-only resources like library resources or keyed software, or you might just want to secure your internet traffic when you are on public or untrusted WiFi.

- [Enable Two-Step Verification for your Brown Account](https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/445-enable-two-step-verification-for-your-brown-account)
- Install the [VPN F5 Desktop Client](https://www.brown.edu/information-technology/software/catalog/vpn-f5-desktop-client)
- Open F5 and connect to the Brown VPN (see screen shots below).

## SSH Client
Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote shell services or command execution and other secure network services between two networked computers that connects, via a secure channel over an insecure network, a server and a client (running SSH server and SSH client programs, respectively). An SSH client is a software program that uses the secure shell protocol to connect to a remote computer.

_Note: Make sure you are on the VPN before trying to SSH to the server._
